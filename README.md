# Self-Study

This little repo on the web will serve as a way for me to keep track of my understanding of computer science and JavaScript so I may have a deeper understand of what's going on underneath the hood. If you happen to stumble upon this...first of all, hello and welcome! Feel free to use these questions as a springboard for your own discovery!

Please refer to this repo's wiki for written self-study questions and answers of theory and fundamentals.

You can find the list of questions in this repo's wiki, or --> [Fundamentals Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://medium.com/@stephenthecurt/33-fundamentals-every-javascript-developer-should-know-13dd720a90d1).

In addition, I will include code snippets organized in folders by their topic!
