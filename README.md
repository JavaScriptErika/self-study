# Self-Study

This little repo on the web will serve as a way for me to keep track of my understanding of computer science and JavaScript so I may have a deeper understand of what's going on underneath the hood. If you happen to stumble upon this...first of all, hello and welcome! Feel free to use these questions as a springboard for your own discovery!

Please refer to this repo's wiki for self-study questions and answers.

A big thank you to [@stephenthecurt](https://twitter.com/stephenthecurt) for providing these questions & guiding me along the way!

You can find the list of questions in this repo's wiki, or --> [Fundamentals Every JavaScript Developer Should Know](https://medium.com/@stephenthecurt/33-fundamentals-every-javascript-developer-should-know-13dd720a90d1).
